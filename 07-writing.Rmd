# Writing and Communication

30-40% of the points on this exam are from communication. In all prior sittings of this exam, candidates did most of their writing at the end of the report. This was called an Executive Summary. As of 4/3/21, the writing questions were moved into the specific tasks with instructions to write “for a general audience.” In these cases, we will teach you how to use non-technical language and other communication techniques previously used in the executive summary.

## Writing Effectively Webinar

This webinar teaches you how to write effectively. Learn how to organize your writing, explain concepts to difference audiences, describe predictive models, and to get maximum scores on the short-answer questions. The second half answers questions from people who took this course such as

- How are exam questions graded?
- When should I upload my documents?
- How do you interpret a logit/probit link function?

And many more!

I do apologize for the first 2 minutes of this webinar not being recorded. I did not press the "record" button on Zoom until after I had given the introduction.
